RK4 appears to be causing energy loss by strange mechanism - shapes fall under graity slightly faster than the should, and rise slightly slower, so lose height each bounce when there's no friction


interesting problems arise when the velocity gets too high - accleration will go to Infinity and it all goes foobar thereonin

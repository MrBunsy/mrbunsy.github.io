L-system thing


the system was adapted so that:

	each branch gradually elongates over time.
	each branch droops slightly by a force each iteration - could specify direction
	total thickness of each height of tree must equal thickenss of trunk below them
-do this by working out how many brances are at each iteration or by branching structure?





my idea:


each branch has:
	
	high chance of continuing another branch straight
	moderate chance of growing anothe branch at an angle

and also implement top ideas of growing and drooping, with thickness

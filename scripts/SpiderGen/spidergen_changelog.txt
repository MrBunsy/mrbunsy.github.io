0.1 (15/09/2008)
-working blob on a spring bouncing about!  Substancial because this is the first use of PARTS of the 2D engine in another context!

0.2 (15/09/2008)
-proper, rendered, string!
-using a fake Render object, with only an adapted drawconnection function.

0.3 (16/09/2008)
-animation thing for swinging off screen largely working.
-bit of cheating by adding extra spring :P

0.4 (17/09/2008)
-wait for still turned down to 1 second
-proper incy-wincy spider style spider!  little smile and legs :D

0.5 (17/09/2008)
-tweaked boost so it gives gradually more boost (swing starts slower, but gets above starting point faster than before)
-detects demise of swinging spider (room for improvement, though)

...

0.7 (17/09/2008)
-finally finished rendering for darwinia spider body, after a few attempts

0.8 (17/09/2008)
-Darwinia spider:
-walking animation!
-can pause!
-can jump!
-is awesome!
-will do somethign every 10th step (on average).  Is twice as likely to jump as stand still.

0.9 (18/09/2008)
-added facing to spider and fixed animations and legs for walking opposite way.
-loop of spiders sort of working.  when the incy-wincy spider appears again it's a big tangled, not sure why.
-removed auto-loading and canvas generating from .js file (makes script easier to add to another project)

1.0 (18/09/2008)
-Added runAlone option - whether script is running physics or not

1.0.1 (18/09/2008)
-fixed what broke.
-fixed legs not lining up with differen frictions.

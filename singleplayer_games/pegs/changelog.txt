0.24 (21/08/2008)
-added mastermind difficulty back, but re-done difficulty levels:
  -easy + medium: as before
  -hard: 8 colours, no repetitions
  -mastermind: as old hard, 8 colours and reptitions.
-re-written help accordingly, and made other clarifications.
-peg outline thickness now the same in IE as all other browsers.
-IE can no longer highlight the canvas (easily).  I added an empty div over the top.

0.25 (23/08/08)
-failed attempting at adding a canvas on the fly

0.26 (24/08/2008)
-succeeded!  IE needs a span with text in (can be display:none;) before the canvas tag in order to recognise it.
-now the html needed to be added is only a div with an id and size!

In <a href="http://director-online.com/buildArticle.cfm?id=346">my last article</a>
we learned how to deal with a gravitation force in Lingo so that we
could simulate a football getting tossed around, a feather dropping
from the sky, or a hammer dropping on your foot. That may seem
interesting to some, but after a brew or two, an evening involving
billiards might seem more interesting. Pool is a game of collisions
(visiting the local pool hall while teaching a physics course is always
worthwhile). When I first started creating simulations with Director I
realized I <b>really</b> need to understand the physics underlying
each particular experiment. Since the goal of this two part article is
to write a basic simulation of pool, we'd better try to learn a bit
about the physics of a collision!
</p><h4><font color="#cc0000" face="Verdana, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pop Quiz</font></h4>

<p>Let's think about a few basic collisions involving an elephant and
myself. (When teaching I would break you all into small groups and let
you discuss these questions amongst yourselves.) </p><p> Suppose I am standing on the side of the road (velocity = 0)
and an elephant runs directly into me. What will happen to me (in
particular my velocity)? What will happen to the elephant and its
velocity? If I run directly into a stationary elephant what will happen
to my velocity? What will happen to the velocity of the elephant? An
elephant and I run straight at one another. What happens to our
velocities?
</p><h4><font color="#cc0000" face="Verdana, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif">Momentum</font></h4>

<p>
We'll get to the answers for the pop quiz, but first let me introduce the term <b>momentum</b>,
which is a rather valued commodity in the world of physics. Momentum
(generally abbreviated as P) is defined to be the mass of an object
multiplied by the velocity of the object. This can be written as
</p><p>
<img src="collison%20equation_files/UD96_eq1.gif" alt="" border="0" height="62" width="80">


</p><p>Momentum can be large or small, as well as positive or negative.
This is known as a vector - it has a magnitude (size), and a direction.
Velocity is also a vector (i.e. I'm driving North at 55 miles per
hour). In Equation 1 the vector is indicated by the small line above
the P and the v. Mass is not a vector (it only has a magnitude, not a
direction).
</p><p>In my last lecture (a.k.a. my previous article) we discussed
the fact that you can have a velocity to the right (a positive Vx), a
velocity down (negative Vy), etc. Momentum "moves" in the same
direction as the velocity. By now I'm sure you are saying "Why are
telling me all this stuff?" Here is the reason: In a collision, the
momentum of a system is conserved (i.e. the total momentum of the
system is the same after the collision as it was before the collision -
or as I like to say, what goes in must come out). A "system" consists
of the two particles that are colliding. We can write this as
</p><p>
<img src="collison%20equation_files/UD96_eq2.gif" alt="" border="0" height="62" width="79">


</p><p>
where the i and the f indicate initial and final (recall that P is momentum).



</p><p>
Here are several examples of momentum.

</p><p>
<img src="collison%20equation_files/UD96_stickfigure.gif" alt="" border="0" height="157" width="279">


</p><p>In Figure 1 I am standing on the road. My velocity is zero. My
mass is 100 kg. I then find that P = 0*100 = 0 (although I would punish
my student for doing this, I am going to skip the 'units' associated
with momentum). I have no momentum. In Figure 2 I am running to the
right at 10 m/s. My mass is still 100 kg. I then find that P = 1000. I
am running to the left at 5 m/s in Figure 3 and my mass (despite all
this running) is still 100 kg. My momentum is now P = (-5)*(100) =
-500, since I have defined the positive direction to be motion to the
right, and negative is to the left. </p><h4><font color="#cc0000" face="Verdana, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back to the quiz</font></h4>

<p>
For question 1, I think that if an elephant ran directly in to me I
would go flying backwards, and the elephant wouldn't really notice the
collision. My students enjoy this question when I do a "stunt" fall
over a table as the virtual elephant runs me down. O.K., lets now think
about me and the elephant in terms of momentum. There are two things in
our "system," me and the elephant. I am not moving, so my momentum is
zero. The elephant is running at me. Let's say the elephant is moving
at 5 m/s, and has a mass of 1000 kg. The initial momentum of the system
= Pme + Pelephant = 0 + 5000 = 5000 (the total momentum before the
collision). </p><p>
After the collision the total momentum must be equal to 5000 due to the
Law of Momentum Conservation. Since I think I will be moving with a
high velocity to the right I can say that I have some positive momentum
which is greater than my initial momentum of zero. Thus, the elephant
must now have less momentum (it got slowed down a bit when it collided
with me). How much did it slow down? To answer this question we need to
introduce one more physics term (I promise it is the last new term for
the day).
</p><h4><font color="#cc0000" face="Verdana, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif">Energy</font></h4>

<p>The term energy is used in many ways ranging from people showing up
for work on Monday morning saying "I have no energy," to chemists
discussing the energy levels of a newly discovered element. For
introductory physics (and this article) we only need to know about
kinetic energy (KE), which is often referred to as the energy of
motion. If something is moving, it has kinetic energy, and if it not
moving it has no kinetic energy. It is defined as
</p><p>
<img src="collison%20equation_files/UD96_eq3.gif" alt="" border="0" height="76" width="117">


</p><p>where m is the mass of the particle, and v is the velocity of
the particle. Kinetic energy is not a vector (it can be large or small,
but does not have a direction associated with it). In an elastic
collision the kinetic energy is conserved: the initial kinetic energy
of the system is equal to the final kinetic energy. We now have two
conservation equations that will let us determine the final velocities
of two colliding particles if we know their initial velocities and
masses.
</p><h4><font color="#cc0000" face="Verdana, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know nothing...</font></h4>

<p>As a graduate student I hated doing homework, so I would often use a
line such as "using Gauss-Jordan elimination, I find that..." which
really meant I had found the answer somewhere else and didn't want to
go through thirty pages of derivation, so in that vain we will jump to
the summary of this momentum and energy conservation dance that occurs
during a collision. The derivation starts with the momentum and energy
conservation statements.
</p><p>
<img src="collison%20equation_files/UD96_eq4.gif" alt="" border="0" height="110" width="338">


</p><p>where the i's indicate initial values, the f's indicate final
values, and the v's are the velocities. I then proceed to do a bit of
algebra, and find that the final velocities of the particles can be
given by
</p><p>
<img src="collison%20equation_files/UD96_eq5.gif" alt="" border="0" height="150" width="297">


</p><p>As I said before, I now know exactly how quickly the particles
are moving after they collide if I know the initial velocities and
masses.
</p><h4><font color="#cc0000" face="Verdana, Arial, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lingo, me, and an elephant</font></h4>

<p>It is apparent that mass is involved in all these equations, so I
begin editing the code from my previous article and add a property to
deal with the mass.
</p><p>
</p><pre><font color="#cc0000">property myMass</font></pre>

<p>That seemed easy enough. I also added a statement to the property
description so that the user can set the mass when slapping the
behavior on me and the elephant.
</p><p>
</p><pre><font color="#cc0000">addprop des,#myMass,[#default:1.0,#format:#float,¬
  #comment:"Mass?"]</font></pre>


<p>The other term I've used throughout this article is "collision." We
will have to detect the collision (the time when particles touch for
the first time), and we will have to tell the particles what their new
velocities should be after the collision. In order to deal with the
latter I add a new handler to the Gravitational Force behavior:
</p><p>
</p><pre><font color="#cc0000"><b>on changeMyVelocity me,newVx,newVy</b>
  set vx = newVx
  set vy = newVy
end</font></pre>


<p>Once I have detected a collision between two particles (sprites) I
can use Equation 5 to solve for the new velocities, but to use the
equation I will need to know the mass of each particle, and the
velocity of each particle, so I add a second handler to the behavior
which will return a list with the mass, x velocity, and y velocity of
the particle.
</p><p>
</p><pre><font color="#cc0000"><b>on reportMyInformation me</b>

  set tempList = []
  add tempList, myMass
  add tempList, vx
  add tempList, vy
  
  return tempList
  
end</font></pre>


<p>The behavior is now complete. To detect the collision I will check
the location of my two particles in a frame script. If the particle are
within a "striking" distance I will implement Equation 5, find the new
velocities, and tell the two particles to change their velocities. In
this article the collision detection will just see if the particles
(sprites) overlap by using the intersect lingo function (in Part 2 of
this article we will change this functionality). I place my two moving
particles in channel 7 and 8, so my frame script is written as
</p><p>
</p><pre><font color="#cc0000"><b>on exitFrame</b>

  -- I place this frame script in a frame labelled 
  -- "before collision"
  if intersect(the rect of sprite 7, the rect of ¬
    sprite 8) = rect(0, 0, 0, 0) then
    nothing
  else
    dealWithCollision(7,8)
  end if
  
  go to the frame
  
end
</font></pre>

<p>The final piece to this puzzle involves the dealWithCollision movie
script that I have called in the exitFrame when the two objects
collide. This is where I must make use of Equation 5 where if you look
a bit more closely at it (here comes the tough part) you'll notice
there are no x's or y's associated with the velocity terms, but we know
that velocity is a vector and has a direction associated with it. In
Equation 5 I only showed two equations but to deal with the
2-dimensional world we have to use two equations for the x-direction,
and two equations for the y-direction. As was mentioned in the previous
article, the x- and y-motion are independent of each other (they each
"do" their own thing). The movie script works as follows:
</p><p>
</p><pre><font color="#cc0000">
  -- you request the mass and current velocity 
  -- from the two sprites involved in the collision
  
  set infoList1 = sendSprite(sprite1,#reportMyInformation)
  set infoList2 = sendSprite(sprite2,#reportMyInformation)
  
  -- you then extract the information from the lists 
  -- that were returned
  set m1 = getat(infoList1,1)
  set m2 = getat(infoList2,1)
  
  -- the v stands for velocity, the i stands for intial, 
  -- the f stands for final, and x and y are the 
  -- two directions
  
  set v1ix = getat(infoList1,2)
  set v2ix = getat(infoList2,2)
  set v1iy = getat(infoList1,3)
  set v2iy = getat(infoList2,3)
  set massTot = m1+m2
  
  -- the next four equations represent Equation 5 from 
  -- the text the first two deal with the x-direction, 
  -- the second two deal with the y-direction
  
  set v1fx = ((m1-m2)*v1ix + 2*m2*v2ix)/massTot
  set v2fx = (2*m1*v1ix + (m2-m1)*v2ix)/massTot
  set v1fy = ((m1-m2)*v1iy + 2*m2*v2iy)/massTot 
  set v2fy = (2*m1*v1iy + (m2-m1)*v2iy)/massTot
  
  -- I now tell the two sprites to change their velocities
  sendSprite(sprite1,#changeMyVelocity,v1fx,v1fy)
  sendSprite(sprite2,#changeMyVelocity,v2fx,v2fy)</font></pre>



<p>Have you made it this far? I'm not even sure if I have. We now have
enough tools to do a full collision, but here are a few more details
important to all of this. In this first article the equations are
becoming rather ominous, but things are still not quite set for
2-dimensional collisions, so we will stick to 1-D collisions today
(such as an air track experiment, or an elephant running in to me).
When an apple sits on my desk, or an elephant stands on the ground, its
acceleration is equal to zero (I promised not to introduce more physics
terms, so I won't mention Normal Forces), and in the behavior I will be
sure that I choose that value. </p><p>
Also, after the collision occurs (I make the call to the
dealWithCollision handler), I am going to jump to a different frame
where I will wait until the particles have "separated," since we never
want a collision to occur and have the dealWithCollision handler called
while the two particle still overlap (this could lead to the particles
getting "stuck" bouncing back and forth within each other). To do this
I add a line after the dealWithCollision line which says
</p><p>
</p><pre><font color="#cc0000">go to "after collision"</font></pre>


<p>and in frame named "after collision" I add a frame script which will
wait for the particles to separate (by waiting until the intersect
function returns an empty rectangle), and then go back to the frame
labelled "before collision" where the whole process will begin once
again.

collision. In the second part of this article we will migrate upward to
a full 2-D elastic collision in an effort to create a game of pool
which will require a more sophisticated method of collision detection,
some added code to determine the angle of the collision, and a frame
script that won't have to jump to another frame after a collision has
occurred. </p><p>

two streams with no gaps, two bases with colour only barriers around them.

several rows of gates, with rows of warrens behind the last one.  One colour can be send off, so the rest can go through a not-that-colour gate.  then down another isle sending off some colours to warrens, till finnally only one type left and use a normal arrow for it.  be careful with numbers of arrows.

if ratio arrows are put in:  Trees with braches, eg, 1:2, 1:1, and so on.  simple to make, harder to play, hopefully.

Also for ratio arrows: only need to use one thing, eg 2 teddys followed by 3 carrots.  But also have red/green and red and green holes in a different pattern to add to confusion :)

Arrow weave idea:
two colours, each with two objects (so, red+carrot, blue+teddy, red+lettuce, blue+book), one blue arrow, one carrot arrow and one book arrow - enough to sort out all 4 types.  then an 8 row deep set of arrows, with only one way across for each group.
-only enough arrows for a really efficient sort.

0.01 (26/08/2008)
-can draw the cards on the board.

0.04 (27/08/2008)
-dragging cards about, picking them up, piling them up and putting them down largely working.
-no rules enforced yet.

0.05 (27/08/2008)
-deck at top works
-ace piles work
-everything except rules and win conditions is done - I think.
-no known bugs or niggles

0.07 (27/08/2008)
-rules enforced
-win condition added (and works)
-win function working (just a You've won! and a new game option atm)
-new game option (with confirm window) added in game

0.08 (27/08/2008)
-double clicking to send aces to stack working.
-also works for other cards (correctly!)
-won't automatically turn over the next card (due to detection being on mouseDOWN and turning over on mouseUP)

0.09 (27/08/2008)
-double click (sort of) working in IE
-canvas slightly faster due to new full option in drawcard
-win easter egg (cascading cards) added.  Barely works in IE, though.

idea for cascade in IE - bouce the minicanvas and draw blanks?

0.10 (28/08/2008)
-cascade more or less working in IE.  The minicanvas is bounced down the screen, drawing rectangles behind it.

0.11 (28/08/2008)
-fixed incorrectly creating blank text
-fixed not being able to start a new game after cascade due to above change
-added menu bar at top
-added about window (click on Solitaire)

0.12 (28/08/2008)
-added drawPile and buildMouseDowns
-for some odd reason, emptying the card span and text array stops the IE dragging a card reallllly slowly bug.  So I've added this to drawPile.  i've given up trying to understand IE
-instead of using clearRect, a blue rectangle is drawn over the old pile (IE doesn't support clearRect properly :P)
-turning cards over on the pile is noticably faster in IE

-slow card drag is still there occasionally in IE

-forcing full draw in IE seems to fix slow card drag - but has a momentary wait.  (as per it used to)

0.13 (29/08/2008)
-experiments to find cause of slow card bug:
  Appears to be when the canvas is selected
  drawPile doesn't add back the blank text - it seems to have gone away once this has happened
-added a blank div over the card when it's being dragged
-might revert to 0.12 and add just the drawPile fix

0.14 (29/08/2008)
-picking up cards in IE now uses drawPile like other browsers
-slow card drag bug fixed
-picking up cards is now much quicker in IE (nearly as good as other browsers).
-called this version 1.4 in About - more useful for this since I don't really need to go up in hundreths :P

0.15 (29/08/2008)
-failed attempting at improving cascade in IE
!!! - DO NOT USE THIS VERSION - !!!

0.16 (29/08/2008)
-double click still turning over next card problem fixed (I think).  I'd been using setInterval (a loop) instead of setTimeout
-added margin-right and left to text at top - looks better.
(01/09/2008)
-added Simple Simon's fix for cards not moving slightly when mouse goes down (math.ceil mousepos)

0.17 (11/09/2008)
-fixed disapearing card glitch found in Spider.

0.18 (12/09/2008)
-supports cards 0.29b and clipping.

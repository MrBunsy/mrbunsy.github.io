0.1 (08/09/2008)
-newGame function working and putting cards in piles.
-draw function working.

0.2 (08/09/2008)
-onMouseDown detections added

0.3 (09/09/2008)
-Cards checkmice function used.  Dragging cards works.
-cards can be dragged to empty space
-Simple Simon card dragging rules working fine

0.4 (09/09/2008)
-stacks going to ace piles working fine (script straight from simple simon), but not animated yet.
-Improved 'squishing' function to detect cards are not facing up  It was noticable when there is a large pile on 4 or so upside down cards.

ideas: Abstract piles further and put in Cards?  A *lot* of script was copied straight from Simple simon and solitaire, I'm sure it could be done.

0.5 (09/09/2008)
-animation for king-ace piles heading to ace stacks working (and tweaked to fit nicely).

0.6 (09/09/2008)
-fixed bug whereby first 5 (meant to be 4) piles had 6 cards.  As a result there are now 50 cards in the spare deck.
-spare deck now stacked to show how many sets of 10 are left.
-clicking spare deck brings down cards (no animation yet)
-tweaked empty deck stacks to space out symbols a bit more vertically.
-win detection tested to be working (but no win function yet)

0.7 (11/09/2008)
-animation for dealing working fairly well.  Could be better, but still good enough for final version I think
-detection for when dealing more cards is allowed added.  Empty spaces and down facing cards will stop more cards being added.
-still no win function

0.8 (11/09/2008)
-tweaked deal animation so there is no longer a slight judder.
-added work-around (Spider.animateInProgress) to clicking repetadly on the spare deck bug.

found odd glitch which I can't reliably reproduce where having the firebug console up, or spider in a small window in firefox, losing focus of the window then clicking in window will lose the card.

found glitch - if you somehow manage to click a hard (mouseDOWN) while a card is being dragged, the card being dragged will vanish.

-fixed above glitch by adding drag==false to pick up stuff.  This glitch may well exist in the other card games.
-simple win function added, and acts after last animation has finished
-reduced default stackheight slightly - stops bits of card underneath dissapearing when not drawn as full, and reduces how often a row needs to be squished.

Weird bug in IE - 8,6 and 9 aren't drawn properly on the minicanvas.  Can't be bothered to fix as I don't see any reason as to why.
-still no undo

0.9 (11/09/2008)
-undo function working, but can undo eveyrhting except ace stacks atm.  Need more options.
-undo not possible after ace stack tested (even works after cards dished out from deck).
-king-ace stack detection afert cards dished out tested to work.

1.0 (11/09/2008)
-experimenting with new clipping technique to stop minicanvas leaving cards div

1.1 (12/09/2008)
-new cliping working, although it's not actually using clip.  A new div exists with overflow:none;
-minicanvas is now relative, and canvas is now absolute
-minicanvas uses left and top to be positioned, rather than margin. (fixes spazness in IE)

1.2 (13/09/2008)
-if more cards can't be dealt, the pile with the reason why will flash yellow

1.3 (13/09/2008)
-non IE browsers use clearRect for drawPile.

1.4 (13/09/2008)
-added options button

1.4b(13/09/2008)
-no options button :P
-undo can't run when animateInProgress is true.
-added animateInProgress to ace stack piles
-option to choose difficulty and undo abilites when creating a new game

1.5 (14-09-08)
-built from 1.4, with some code taken from 1.4b
-simple start game dialogue back again
-option menu for changing undo level (set to normal by default.)
-fixed exploit where a card could be turned over while the card on top was being dragged.
-opening a menu calls draw first, stopping them from being able to overlap.
-finished Help and About menus.
-everything except ending easter egg is done, I think.

BUG stack check doesn't check to see if a card is actually facing up!

improve undo options - don't auto close menu?  get rid of daft explainations in brackets?

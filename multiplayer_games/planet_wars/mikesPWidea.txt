ok, yes there are inacessible points, it'll happen when the potential difference between the two ships is larger than 0.5 x 200^2 (i.e. the energy difference between the two points is larger than the K.E. of the projectile), other than that there *should* be a way though in theory (or at least there would be in an infinite playing field....) provided the ship isnt completely surrounded by planets, or any path has to pass thorugh a region of potential which is high enough that projectiles cant reach it (like if both ships had a black hole behind in such a way that projectiles would turn back before the neutral point). so.... black hole strength should be tailored so that the max distance that a projectile can travel from the minimum distance a ship can start from a black hole, is the same as the diagonal of the playing field minus the min distance... tell me the dimensions and i can crunch some numbers for you if you want

or just have the mapgen disallow maps where theres a point with enough of a P.D. from the ship that a projectile couldnt reach it..., oh, and an overlay to show equipotentils would be cool if poss, mostly cos it lets me fiddle about with orbits :P

0.14b (26/09/2008)

-coloured circle drawn to give rough idea of how far darwinian can move

0.15 (26/09/2008)
-cells darwinians can move to highlighted (slow, though)

0.16 (26/09/2008)
-distance saving seems to work, also noticable improvement in speed.

0.17 (26/09/2008)
-had to distable nice saving system :(
-this means that enemy darwinians can now be taken into account as impassable cells.
-something broke

0.17b (26/09/2008)
-built from 0.16, same features as 0.17
-can capture empty spawns.

0.18 (26/09/2008)
-function for changing spawn ownership when nothing on spawn and enemy nearby. (run at wrong time atm)

0.21 (26/09/2008)
-battle function works out nearby cells and rolls a die

0.23 (27/09/2008)
-battlePart2 can work out correct targets

0.24 (27/09/2008)
-lasers!
-dice colours changed to make teams obvious
-crash on line 387 - while(MWBG.peices[MWBG.mapCells[fromCell].enemiesNear[tempTarget]].firedAt && targetsTried.length<MWBG.mapCells[fromCell].enemiesNear.length)
in findTarget
no idea why, and none of the enemiesNear had obvious problems.

IDEA - enemyNearBy lacks check for edge of map?

FIXED BUG!!
-when multiwinians spawned, col and row were set the WRONG WAY ROUND, causing a cell with no multiwininas to try and attack.
-probably still need to check for edge of map, though.

0.25 (27/09/2008)
-hopefully can't click I've Finished Moving mid-battle anymore
-darwinian is now killed off when capturing an empty spawn

0.26 (27/09/2008)
-fixed not being able to capture enemy spawn (killPeice function)

0.27 (27/09/2008)
-dice spin for 2 secs.

idea for dieing - go dark and get thinner?
switch back to darwinians, not dice, for firing lasers?

0.28 (29/09/2008)
-optimised grid highlighting when selecting darwinians:
  now only checks small area of board
  cellDistance has a cheat if cells are bordering
-so it now works in IE!  Still not *as* fast as drawing a circle, but more acceptable.
